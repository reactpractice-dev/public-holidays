# Build a Public Holidays app

> This repository is the companion to the ["Build a Public Holidays app"](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-public-holidays-app/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=public-holidays) practice exercise.

Build a React application that shows the national holidays for the current year, for a given country.

You can retrieve a list of available countries and their holidays from the [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/en/api/).

By default, you should show the holidays for The Netherlands.

## Getting started:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
